## Chronotype analysis 

### Fig 1: Table of responses

| Sleep Online ↓ / Assessment Centre → | Definitely Evening | Definitely Morning | Rather Evening | Rather Morning |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------:|--------------------:|----------------:|----------------:|
| **Definitely Evening**               | 7,675               | 264                | 5,597           | 612             |
| **Definitely Morning**              | 287                 | 26,570             | 1,857           | 14,412          |
| **Rather Evening**                  | 5,651               | 1,068              | 21,157          | 5,017           |
| **Rather Morning**                  | 1,193               | 12,751             | 13,222          | 37,231          |

- As seen in figure 1, participants who reported being Definitely Morning or Rather Morning online often reported similar morningness in the assessment centre, indicating moderate to strong self-report consistency over time.

- There is some asymmetry; for example, a notable portion of those who self-identified as Rather Morning online later identified as Definitely Morning in the assessment centre.

- Those who reported being Definitely Evening online also frequently reported Rather Evening or Definitely Evening later, again suggesting consistency, though with some shift toward less extreme responses.

- These results highlight that while most individuals report consistent sleep preferences, some variability over time or context (online vs interview) exists.

- This variability could reflect natural changes in circadian preference or the influence of social/interpretive factors when responding to questions in different formats.


## Self-Reported Chronotype vs rMEQ-Derived Chronotype (Online)
### Fig 2: self-reported vs rMEQ chronotype

| Self-Reported ↓ / rMEQ-Based → | Definitely evening | Definitely morning | Intermediate | Rather evening | Rather morning |
|-------------------------------|--------------------:|--------------------:|-------------:|----------------:|----------------:|
| **Definitely evening**        |                 558 |                   0 |        4399  |           9116  |               1 |
| **Definitely morning**        |                   0 |                7143 |        1501  |              0  |           35275 |
| **Rather evening**            |                   8 |                   0 |       33863  |           1221  |              69 |
| **Rather morning**            |                   0 |                  50 |       50541  |             10  |           21287 |



I also compared each participant’s self-reported chronotype (the single question in the Sleep Online survey) to their rMEQ-derived chronotype, calculated using five specific questions assessing sleep timing, alertness, and preferences.
There is strong agreement for the extreme types:

- Most people who self-reported as "Definitely Morning" were classified as either Definitely Morning or Rather Morning by the rMEQ score.

- Similarly, those who self-reported as "Definitely Evening" were largely classified as Rather Evening or Definitely Evening.

- However, there is also notable discrepancy:
  -  A large number of participants who self-identified as "Rather Morning" were classified as Intermediate (50,541) by rMEQ, suggesting that self-perception may overestimate morningness
  -  A similar pattern exists for those who self-identified as "Rather Evening", many of whom were actually Intermediate per rMEQ.
  -  Only a small number of participants were completely mismatched (e.g. someone saying "Definitely Morning" but scoring "Definitely Evening").
